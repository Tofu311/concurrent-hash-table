Compilation and Execution instructions
--------------------------------------
Unzip G3-PA2.zip into a new folder
Open a command line terminal (powershell, unix terminal, etc)
Locate the folder you unzipped into using cd commands in the terminal

To compile the program, type: 
	make
and press enter.

the code should now be compiled into the executable file, the important file is chash.exe


to run the program, type:
	./chash.exe
and press enter.

The program will run and output a new file into its own directory, "output.txt"

Note that repeated runs of chash.exe will yield varying output.exe results, which
is expected due to the unpredictable nature of scheduling and thread execution.
